Deliberately vague


Workstream with tasks inside of it
* Tasks are going to have a start and end
* Tasks have a title

* We should be able to drag tasks between workstreams
* We should be able to resize tasks to take longer by clicking and dragging
* Ideally we want to manually specify dates for exactness.

* We need the ability to add either new tasks or new work streams
* We need to be able to collapse the sidebar

* We should be able to hover over a task and see what the full text is and date details
	* Make a hover card


* Assignees/Color coding things 

Drag and drop means changing either the date or the workstream

We probably want another view just for managing tasks separate from Dnd for specifics



I would put multiple things per workstream

* Subtasks


Dark mode
Style pass. Better fonts
Ideally responsive, works on muiltiple screen size
